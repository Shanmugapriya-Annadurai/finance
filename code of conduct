A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community. For more information on why a code of conduct defines standards and expectations for how to engage in a community, see the Open Source Guide.

Before adopting a code of conduct for your project:

Research different codes of conduct designed for open source projects. Choose one that reflects your community's standards.
Consider carefully whether you are willing and able to enforce it.
